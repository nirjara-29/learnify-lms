Card Number: 4111 1111 1111 1111

Expiry Date: Any future date

Cardholder Name: Any name

⚠️ Note: On the Buy Now page, please wait 4–5 seconds for the Razorpay payment keys to fully load.
If the button doesn't work immediately, try going back and re-clicking Subscribe.
This delay occurs due to a cold start on the server hosted via Render.
