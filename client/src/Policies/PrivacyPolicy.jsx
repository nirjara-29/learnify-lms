        This policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information.
      </p>
      <p>
        As this is a development project, please note that actual data handling practices
        for a live application would require a more comprehensive and legally compliant policy.

      <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        We do not share your personal information with third parties except as necessary
